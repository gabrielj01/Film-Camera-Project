    <h2>Here is a list of things we are going to talk about on this page. </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Common size</li>
            <li>ISO Sensibility</li>
            <li>Differents type of films</li>
            <li>Special formats</li>
            <li>Storage and Preservation</li>
            <li>Development and Printing</li>
        </ol>  
    <h3>Common size</h3>
        <p>Photographic film is available in several sizes, the most common being: <br>
            35mm: The most popular format, used in most 35mm cameras. <br>
            120mm: Also known as medium format, used in medium format cameras.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="list">35mm</li>
                <p>This format is the most common. The film is typically 35mm wide and is loaded in cartridges that make it easy to load into the camera. <br>
                    It produces standard 24mm x 36mm rectangular images.
                    35mm films are available in various sensitivities (ISO), suitable for different lighting conditions.</p>
            <li class="list">120 mm</li>
                    <p>Used in medium format cameras, this format offers superior image quality due to its larger size compared to 35mm. <br>
                        The images produced have varying dimensions depending on the camera, <br> generally around 6 cm x 6 cm or 6 cm x 9 cm.
                        This format is popular for artistic and professional photography.
                    </p>
        </ol>
    <h3>ISO Sensibility</h3>
        <p>Film films have different ISO sensitivities to accommodate varying light conditions. <br>
            Lower sensitivity films (ISO 100-200) are suitable for daylight, while higher sensitivity films (ISO 800 and above) are suitable for low light conditions.
        </p>
    <h3>Differents type of films</h3>
        <p>Black and White: Offers a timeless aesthetic, ideal for artistic expression. <br>
            Color: Available in various palettes, each offering distinct tones. <br>

        </p>
    <h3> Special formats </h3>
        <p>Some films offer special formats, such as panoramic format or half format, allowing for increased creativity.
            <br> These formats are suitable for professional and high-quality applications.
        </p>
    <h3>Storage and Preserve</h3>
        <p>Silver films are sensitive to heat, humidity and light. Storage in cool, dry conditions is crucial to maintaining their quality.
            <br> To preserve a film, it is recommended to clean it regularly and store it in airtight containers.
        </p>
    <h3>Development and Printing</h3>
        <p>
            After shooting, film film requires a process of developing and printing to obtain final images. <br>
             This can be done professionally or at home for experienced amateurs.
            <br> This process includes development, stopping, fixing, and washing.
