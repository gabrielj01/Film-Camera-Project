        Introduction
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;

    text-align: center;">
        Photographic film is a light-sensitive material used in traditional film photography to capture and record
        images. <br> It consists of a thin, flexible, transparent base coated with a light-sensitive emulsion containing
        silver halide crystals. <br> When exposed to light, these crystals undergo a chemical reaction, forming a latent
        image on the film. <br> This latent image is then developed into a visible image through a series of chemical
        processes.
    </p>
    <h3>Types of Film</h3>
    <p>
        Black and White (B&W): Contains silver halide crystals sensitive to all wavelengths of visible light. <br>
        Color Negative: Consists of three emulsion layers, each sensitive to a different primary color (red, green, and
        blue). <br>
        Color Reversal (Slide): Similar to color negative but produces a positive image directly on the film. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Film Formats</h3>
    <p>35mm: Commonly used for amateur and professional photography. <br>
        Medium Format: Larger than 35mm, used in professional and high-quality applications. <br>
        Large Format: Even larger, often used for studio or landscape photography.
    </p>
    <h3>ISO Sensitivity</h3>
    <p>Film speed is the measure of a photographic film's sensitivity to light, determined
        by sensitometry and measured on various numerical scales, <br> the most recent being the ISO system introduced
        in 1974. A closely related system,
        also known as ISO, is used to describe the relationship between <br> exposure and output image lightness in
        digital
        cameras. Prior to ISO, the most common systems were ASA in the U.S. and DIN in Europe.</p>
