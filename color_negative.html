    <h3> Composition </h3>
    <p> Color negative film consists of multiple layers of emulsion that react to different wavelengths of light. <br>
        Layers typically include blue-sensitive, green-sensitive, and red-sensitive emulsion.
    </p>

    <h3> Color Balance</h3>
    <p>Color negative film is designed to produce a negative image where colors are inverted. <br>
        The film has an orange mask that helps in color correction during the printing process.
    </p>

    <h3>Grain Structure</h3>
    <p>Exhibits a characteristic grain structure, with finer grains in lower ISO films and more noticeable grains in
        higher ISO films. <br>
        Grain can contribute to the aesthetic appeal of the final image.
    </p>

    <h3>Wide Exposure Latitude</h3>
    <p>Color negative film has a forgiving exposure latitude, allowing for some flexibility in exposure settings. <br>
        This makes it suitable for photographers learning the craft
    </p>

    <h3>Processing</h3>
    <p>Requires color negative processing, involving developing, stopping, fixing, and washing stages. <br>
        C-41 is the standard chemical process for color negative film.
    </p>

    <h3>Archival Stability</h3>
    <p>Color negative film is known for its relatively good archival stability when stored properly.</p>
