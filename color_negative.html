        <p>Color negative film is a popular medium in the world of analog photography, known for its versatility and
            widespread use. <br> Here's a comprehensive guide to learn about this essentially part of the photographic film
            !</p>

    <div class="grid composition">
        <h3> Composition </h3>
            <p> Color negative film consists of multiple layers of emulsion that react to different wavelengths of light. <br>
                Layers typically include blue-sensitive, green-sensitive, and red-sensitive emulsion.
            </p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid color-balance">   
        <h3> Color Balance</h3>
            <p>Color negative film is designed to produce a negative image where colors are inverted. <br>
                The film has an orange mask that helps in color correction during the printing process.
            </p>
    </div> 

    <div class="grid grain-structure">
        <h3>Grain Structure</h3>
        <p>Exhibits a characteristic grain structure, with finer grains in lower ISO films and more noticeable grains in
            higher ISO films. <br>
            Grain can contribute to the aesthetic appeal of the final image.
        </p>
    </div> 

    <div class="grid wide-exposure">
        <h3>Wide Exposure Latitude</h3>
        <p>Color negative film has a forgiving exposure latitude, allowing for some flexibility in exposure settings. <br>
                This makes it suitable for photographers learning the craft
        </p>
    </div> 

    <div class="grid processing">
        <h3>Processing</h3>
        <p>Requires color negative processing, involving developing, stopping, fixing, and washing stages. <br>
            C-41 is the standard chemical process for color negative film.
        </p>
    </div> 

    <div class="grid archival-stability">
        <h3>Archival Stability</h3>
            <p>Color negative film is known for its relatively good archival stability when stored properly.</p>
    </div>
