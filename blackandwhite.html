    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Black and white photography, often abbreviated as B&W, is a form of photography that captures images without
        recording colors. <br> Instead, it relies solely on shades of gray, ranging from pure black to pure white. <br>
        Black and
        white photography has a timeless and classic quality, and it can be used to emphasize composition, form, and
        contrast.
    </p>
    <h3>Film Selection</h3>
    <p>
        <strong> Film Type:</strong> Black and white film comes in various types and sensitivities (ISO/ASA). Different
        films offer different grain structures, contrast levels, and tonal qualities. <br>
        <strong>Loading Film:</strong> In analog (film) photography, the photographer loads a roll of black and white
        film into the
        camera before taking pictures.
    </p>
    <h3>Short Brief</h3>
    <p>
        Black and white photography allows for a focus on the interplay of light and shadow, shapes, and textures
        without the distraction of color. <br> It has a rich history and is still appreciated for its ability to convey mood,
        emotion, and a sense of timelessness. <br> Many photographers continue to use black and white film or simulate the
        look digitally to create striking and evocative images.
