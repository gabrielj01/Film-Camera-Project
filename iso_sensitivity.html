    <h1>ISO Sensitivity</h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="intro"> ISO sensitivity is an important aspect of film cameras that affects how your photos turn out. <br>
        Think of ISO as the camera's sensitivity to light. Here's a simple breakdown:</p>
    <h2>Here is a list of things we are going to talk about on this page.</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>What is ISO ?</li>
        <li> ISO Ratings</li>
        <li>Adjusting ISO</li>
        <li>Auto ISO</li>
        <li>Experimenting with ISO</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>What is ISO ?</h3>
    <p>ISO, which stands for International Organization for Standardization, is a measure of your camera's sensitivity to light. 
        <br> In the context of film cameras, it represents the sensitivity of the film to light. 
        <br> In digital cameras, it refers to the sensitivity of the image sensor.</p>
    <h3>ISO Ratings</h3>
    <p class="subtitle">Low ISO (e.g., ISO 100 or 200):</p>
        <p>Best suited for well-lit conditions.
        Produces images with fine detail and minimal grain. <br>
        Ideal for bright outdoor scenes with lots of natural light.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Medium ISO (e.g., ISO 400 or 800):</p> 
        <p>Offers a balanced sensitivity for varying lighting conditions. <br>
        Good for overcast days or indoor settings with moderate available light.
        Strikes a balance between detail and sensitivity.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">High ISO (e.g., ISO 1600 and above): </p>
        <p>Reserved for low-light situations.
        Increases sensitivity to capture more light in dim environments. <br>
        However, higher ISO settings may introduce more noticeable grain or noise, affecting image quality.</p>
    <h3>Adjusting ISO</h3>
        <p class="subtitle">1)When to Use Low ISO:</p>
        <p>In well-lit scenes to maintain optimal image quality.
         During daylight hours or outdoor shoots with abundant natural light.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">2)When to Use Medium ISO:</p>
        <p>In situations with moderate lighting, like overcast days or indoor settings.
        <br>Balances sensitivity and detail for versatile shooting conditions.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">3)When to Use High ISO:</p>
        <p>In low-light conditions such as evening events or indoor scenes with limited light.
        <br>Sacrifices some image quality for the sake of capturing a properly exposed image in challenging lighting. </p>
    <h3>Auto ISO</h3>
    <p>
        Many modern cameras feature an "Auto ISO" setting. 
        In this mode, <br> the camera adjusts ISO automatically based on the available light, 
        providing convenience in dynamic lighting situations.
    </p>
    <h3>Experimenting with ISO</h3>
    <p>
        Understanding ISO sensitivity empowers you to control the exposure of your photos.
        <br>Experiment with different ISO settings in various lighting conditions to observe their impact on image quality
        <br> and choose the appropriate setting for your desired outcome.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>By grasping the nuances of ISO sensitivity, <br>photographers can optimize their camera settings to capture the best possible images in diverse shooting environments.</p>
